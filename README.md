# Rainfall Predictive Model

## DSCI 525 - Web and Cloud Computing

Group8 project for DSCI 525 - Web and Cloud Computing as part of the Master of Data Science at UBC.

The goal of the project is to build and deploy ensemble machine learning models to predict daily rainfall in Australia. As part of
the course objectives, we will examine the limitations of working on our computers as well as the advantages of doing so on the cloud.

Throughout the project we will be addressing the following milestones:

**Milestone 1 (Week 1)** - Get the Data from Web & familiarize with advanced file formats

**Milestone 2 (Week 3)** - Setup S3 bucket, EC2 instance & TLJH

**Milestone 3 (Week 4)** - Setup EMR-spark instance & rewrite ML model you have from previous milestone in spark

**Milestone 4 (Week 5)** - Deploy ML model using flask

## Report

Please find the report of the project in a notebook [here](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/525-group8/tree/main/notebooks).

## Data

The data used for this project is a very large rainfall dataset (>6GB) that can be found in [figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Daily_rainfall_over_NSW_Australia/14096681).

The features are outputs of different climate models and the target is the actual observed rainfall. This dataset contains
observations from 1889 to 2014.
