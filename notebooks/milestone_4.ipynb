Here we are going to create a new endpoint that accepts a POST request of the features required to run the machine learning model that you trained and saved in last milestone (i.e., a user will post the predictions of the 25 climate model rainfall predictions, i.e., features,  needed to predict with your machine learning model).

We'll be using `screen`. `screen` will allow us to create a separate session within which we can run `flask` and which won't shut down when we exit the main shell session. Read [this](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-linux-screen/) to learn more on ```screen```.\n",
    "10. Now, create a new `screen` session (think of this as a new, separate shell), using: `screen -S myapi`. If you want to list already created sessions do ```screen -list```. If you want to get into an existing ```screen -x myapi```.\n",
    "11. Within that session, start up your flask app. You can then exit the session by pressing `Ctrl + A then press D`. Here you are detaching the session, once you log back into EC2 instance you can attach it using ```screen -x myapi```.\n",
    "12. Feel free to exit your connection with the EC2 instance now and try accessing your service again with `curl`. You should find that the service has now persisted!\n",

    "It has certainly been quite a new and interesting journey. None of us had used these web services nor deployed a model. From our first team meeting, we kicked it off great and our main learning objectives for this course were learning about cloud and web services and getting familiar with AWS interface. \n",
    "\n",
    "We put on our Data Engineer hat for Milestone 1. It was a great way to start realizing the limits of our laptops and how useful cloud services are, especially working with big data. Since we were running the code in the local machine, it took a long time to run. We combatted these problems by having to restart from scratch if there's anything we want to modify from the start which was frustrating. Everytime we reran the notebook, we had to delete the downloaded files and redownload it again, which is quite challenging for large-scale data processing. As we only had one single machine, our EDA was very simple, we could hardly visualize our data or calculate correlation matrices. We were unable to do deep EDA like plots (histograms, correlation matrices, etc.) to show relationships between features because the data was so large and taking a sample of the data would not be ideal. To combat this we focused on simpler EDA methods such as analyzing mean/median/mode and count values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Milestone 2 we got hands on AWS with our Infrastructure hat on. It was somehow confusing but understandable given that it was our first time using it. We all created an EC2 instance to practice. After that we focused on student81 EC2 t2.large instance with JupyterHub. We also set up the S3 bucket to move our data from M1 to S3. We learned different storage options and knowing that we just needed pretty much to upload once, S3 bucket was ideal. After that, we prepared the data for our ML predictive model. This part was not that new to us but making sure we could all see the file in JupyterHub was tricky.\n",
    "\n",
    "During Milestone 3, setting up the EMR cluster was pretty straight forward. However, setting up the browser, Jupyter environment and connecting to master node, was also somewhat tricky. Not really difficult but we encountered a few issues that we were fortunate to solve in the spot. After that, with our Data Scientist hat, developing the ML model with scikit-learn was more familiar to us as opposed to obtaining the best hyperparameter setting using spark’s MLlib.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally Milestone 4, and we wore our DevOps hat. We had our model ready and it was time to deploy it. We encountered many issues when trying to connect to the public IP. We did not know exactly why was it but in the end it was just a mistake on our side using the wrong EC2 instance with the wrong Security group. Once we passed that, everything else went smoothly and we were able to successfully deploy our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, we believe it was a great experience to use all those different hats and have a better sense of a full process. Indeed we felt better with the Data Scientist hat on but it was very interesting to use the other three. It is always nice to be able to complete a project from beginning to end with the instructor and TA’s guidance. We will keep the Data Scientist hat on but will not hesitate to use any other hat when needed.\n"
