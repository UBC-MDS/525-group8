    "You probably got how to set up primary URL endpoints from the ```sampleproject.ipynb notebook``` and have them process and return some data. Here we are going to create a new endpoint that accepts a POST request of the features required to run the machine learning model that you trained and saved in last milestone (i.e., a user will post the predictions of the 25 climate model rainfall predictions, i.e., features,  needed to predict with your machine learning model).

    "    \n",
    "    2.2 Or else you can make a file in your laptop called app.py and copy it over to your EC2 instance using ```scp```. Eg: ```scp -r -i \"ggeorgeAD.pem\" ~/Desktop/worker.py  ubuntu@ec2-xxx.ca-central-1.compute.amazonaws.com:~/```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Download your model from s3 to your EC2 instance.\n",

    "    4.1. You have installed it in your TLJH using [Installing pip packages](https://tljh.jupyter.org/en/latest/howto/env/user-environment.html#installing-pip-packages). if you want to make it available to users outside of jupyterHub (which you want to in this case as we are logging into EC2 instance as user ```ubuntu``` by giving ```ssh -i privatekey ubuntu@<host_name>```) you can follow these [instructions](https://tljh.jupyter.org/en/latest/howto/env/user-environment.html#accessing-user-environment-outside-jupyterhub).\n",

    "6. You can now access your service by typing your EC2 instances public IPv4 address appened with `:8080` into a browswer, so something like `http://<your_EC2_ip>:8080`.\n",
    "7. You should use `curl` to send a post request to your service to make sure it's working as expected.\n",

    "8. Now, what happens if you exit your connection with the EC2 instance? Can you still reach your service?\n",
    "9. There are several options we could use to help us persist our server even after we exit our shell session. We'll be using `screen`. `screen` will allow us to create a separate session within which we can run `flask` and which won't shut down when we exit the main shell session. Read [this](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-linux-screen/) to learn more on ```screen```.\n",
    "10. Now, create a new `screen` session (think of this as a new, separate shell), using: `screen -S myapi`. If you want to list already created sessions do ```screen -list```. If you want to get into an existing ```screen -x myapi```.\n",
    "11. Within that session, start up your flask app. You can then exit the session by pressing `Ctrl + A then press D`. Here you are detaching the session, once you log back into EC2 instance you can attach it using ```screen -x myapi```.\n",
    "12. Feel free to exit your connection with the EC2 instance now and try accessing your service again with `curl`. You should find that the service has now persisted!\n",
    "13. ***CONGRATULATIONS!!!*** You have successfully got to the end of our milestones. Move to Task 3 and submit it."
