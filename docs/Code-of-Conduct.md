    private communication without consent

### Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Participants who are asked to stop any inappropriate behavior are
expected to comply immediately. This applies to any DSCI 525 Group 8
events and platforms, either online or in-person. If a participant
engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the teaching
team may warn the offender and or engage the DSCI 525 Instructor to
investigate the Code of Conduct violation and impose appropriate
sanctions.
